# SQL Injection

This folder documents my hands-on learning of SQL injection vulnerabilities
through PortSwigger Web Security Academy labs.

## Focus areas:
-  Identifying injectable parameters
-  Exploiting error-based, union-based, and blind SQL injection
-  Observing real-world filtering and defenses

## Check:
-  `notes.md` for lab observations and lessons
-  `payloads.md` for commonly used payload patterns
