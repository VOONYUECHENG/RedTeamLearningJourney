# SQL Injection

This folder documents my hands-on learning of SQL Injection vulnerabilities
through PortSwigger Web Security Academy labs.

Focus areas:
- Identifying injectable parameters
- Exploiting error-based, union-based, and blind SQL injection
- Observing real-world filtering and defenses

See:
- `notes.md` for lab observations and lessons
- `payloads.md` for commonly used payload patterns
- `labs.md` for selected lab walkthroughs
